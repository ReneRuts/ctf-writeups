# Epic Number Guesser: 4

## Description
Download the program. All "Epic Number Guesser Game" challenges use the same program. There are five hidden flags within the program—find them(duh)!

To help you identify which flag needs to be submitted, I’ve included a number in each flag.

Example: HCTF-FLAG-1_kfkdfkdfkdf This would be the flag for Epic Number Guesser: 1.

Note: Flags are not case-sensitive.

## Files Provided
"epic.exe" [file](./Epic%20Number%20Guesser/epic.exe)

## Writeups
When you  guessed 5 numbers correctly, it gives an error that it can't find `flag.txt`

If you create a flag.txt file and retry it will store the flag in the file.
