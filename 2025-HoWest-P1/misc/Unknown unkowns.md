# Unknown unknowns

## Description
Didn't that guy get stabbed to death?

You'll have to manually add -'s to the flag.

## Files Provided
"UnknownUnknowns.png" [file](./Unknown%20unknowns/UnknownUnknowns.png)

## Writeups
Noticed it was the same cipher used in [Known unknowns](./Known%20unknowns.md)

This gave me: OJAMMSHNSPRLAOLKYLZZPUN

Since I know the flag should have 2 'F's inside of it I tried to use ceasar cipher to get something like HCTFFLAG

which gave me the flag.


## Flag
```
HCTF-FLAG-LIKE_THE_DRESSING
```
