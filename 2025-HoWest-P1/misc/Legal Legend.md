# Legal Legend

## Description
Yeah... I'm in trouble again. I've got one phone call left, and would like to call my lawyer. The problem is, I've forgotten his name & phone number, but I do remember it had a catchy ring to it.

Once you've found his number, try to find his name.

Flag format is, HCTF-FLAG-FIRSTNAME_LASTNAME
