To jump or not to jump that is the question.

## Files Provided
"changethejump"

## Writeups
Someone told us to download a program called "binary ninja"

when opening the file using that program we could change all jumps in the code (a jump is the part where it goes from a line to another line)

after changing the jump to the correct one and running the changed file it gave us the flag.
