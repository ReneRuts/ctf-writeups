# Who formatted this??

## Description
No seriously who formatted this, I mean it works but why is it so ugly????

## Files Provided
"c_mc_face.c"

## Writeups
First thought we had to do something with the code inside the file, teacher gave us a hint which was. "U don't have to use the code, you didn't see 'C' yet. Sadly enough :("

Then we started looking at the whitespace in front of every line.

After a while we noticed that the amount of spaces (whitespace) in front of the code represented a decimal value of the ascii table

which ended up being:
72 67 84 70 45 70 76 65 71 45 106 97 118 97 115 99 114 105 112 116 73 115 83 111 77 117 99 104 66 101 116 116 101 114

which is the ascii value for the flag.
