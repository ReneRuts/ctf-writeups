Gene & the PR people asked us to give him some footage about this course, so we're tasking you too create some crazy creative & funny stuff!

Create a minimum 20 second video/compilation with pictures of your team, favorite challenge, you explaining what CTF is and what you did.

If you don't want to be in the picture, just take a picture of a teammate (without face working on his favorite challenge in the ctf, or working on your own challenge!)

Upload this to LeHo & come show your video to the coaches! We'll reward you with a flag :D
