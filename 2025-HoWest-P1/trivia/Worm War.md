# Worm War

## Description
The Blaster worm took advantage of a vulnerability in Microsoft Windows and began spreading rapidly. However, a second worm emerged, not just exploiting the same vulnerability but also attempting to stop the original worm by patching the system. This worm was designed to counteract the damage caused by Blaster while spreading itself.
